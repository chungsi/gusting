## The Project

**stack**: Laravel & PHP, SASS & CSS3, HTML5, JS & JQuery, WordPress

As a hybrid designer-developer on the digital marketing team, I built the foundations of a scalable design system for the company's 15-year-old website to provide a consistent brand experience while reducing development redundancy. I led the development of both the visual style as well as the front-end and back-end implementation of newly created designs. This included creating the CSS architecture and modular Laravel (Blade) components. While this was taking place, I simultaneously created and maintained the subsite where the documentation lived.

As the team grew to include more designers, developers, and writers, the design system also expanded to include accessibility, visual, and writing guidelines. It became so successful that it was consulted by other product and sales teams within the company, spurring more conversations about investing in design.

## Detailed Breakdown

### The Problem & Approach

Before beginning the project, we assessed the following issues:

- Many different eras of branding across thousands of pages, with varying colour schemes;
- Platforms between pages were not consistent (some were hard-coded PHP/HTML & CSS with no templating engine, while others lived in WordPress);
- Overall page and component designs varied due to inconsistent & standalone CSS files;
- Lack of consolidated design & development guidelines and standards in the company, even from the other web & software products.

As it wouldn't be feasible to update thousands of pages at once, the project was started with the intent of being a long-term, living project. Our first steps included:

1. Creating a simple style guide with basic colour schemes, typography, and component patterns that all new pages would follow
2. Using the front-end framework Foundation for their interactive components & accessibility tools, customising as needed
3. Introducing a templating engine to have a single source of code for these new components. We chose Laravel and Blade as the site was already built completely in PHP. This would also allow us to connect the WP templates to our components.

Throughout the process, I maintained a documentation subsite that would develop along with the scope of the design system.

### The Documentation Subsite

Early on in the project, I was adamant about setting time aside to create good documentation to aid onboarding, development, and day-to-day design. After all, readable, up-to-date documentation is just as important as readable, up-to-date code.

The documentation began as a mockup of basic typography and colours but naturally evolved to become a living subsite containing design guidelines, component library, code standards, accessibility rules, and writing guidelines.
