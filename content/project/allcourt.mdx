## My Roles

visual design & UI  
web & prototype development  
UX: user research & interviews


## Pitch

User experience (UX) design is a process that can make experiences meaningful. While a growing field, there is a fundamental lack of UX skills in non-technical industries where it could make an impact and improve performance.

Our team focused on one such domain, competitive tennis. It comprises of three parties of interest: competitive tennis players (anyone highly motivated to improve their performance), junior players and their parents, and coaches. Our competitor analysis and user interviews revealed that currently available software solutions (smartphone apps) are difficult to learn and use. Thus, we prototyped an assistive-coaching experience that helps optimize player performance based on data that both players and coaches can analyse.

Below is the final interactive prototype that can be explored and played with â€“ please go ahead! A more detailed breakdown of the various parts is detailed in the Implementation Process.

This project was accepted into the juried SFU FCAT Undergraduate Conference, 2020, to be presented.


## My Contributions

With a small team of three and very tight timelines, we were all highly involved in every step of the process and rigorously critiqued each other's work. Nevertheless, we each had our areas of expertise; I was the primary visual designer (for both the interface and visual analytics), the primary web & prototype developer, and was highly involved in the user experience design.

I designed the visuals and illustrations for our progress blog, and designed the interface and iconography for the prototype, paying special attention to the visual analytics and score-keeping process. We made various prototypes using both prototyping software (Adobe Xd & Figma) and code; I was the lead developer in both cases.
