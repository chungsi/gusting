## Concept Overview

Death comes for us all, but the emphasis on prolonging life in Western society has led us to shy away from talking about and preparing for death. Medicine is caught up in "lifesaving", taking away the conversation and control we should have on how we pass away. But the very acts of realizing and accepting our imminent doom is what brings about inner peace and planning for the future. By facing death, not only can we live with passion, but also pass with passion. As Peter Saul, a long-time ICU specialist, explains, "how we die is actually really important" for both us and the people that survive us, but this can only be addressed if conversation is opened.

In _Threads to Heaven_, we wish to raise the conversation of death — how to appreciate, accept, and talk about it — in our daily lives. Our project explores a lengthy and involved process of preparing for one's own death in a symbiotic relationship with another living organism, the fungi. As one maintains and feeds the fungi with bits of oneself, such as nails, hair, and dead skin, one can also feed on the fruiting mushrooms. At the end of one's life, Threads to Heaven can fully cleanse and decompose the body while also becoming the living legacy that carries on their journey.

We explore how one's relationship with both life and death would change by living with this fungi. We question whether death should be such a taboo topic in the Western society, and whether one can choose and design their own "good death". Through the rituals and stories born from the product, we aim to enable our audience to open their own conversations on death with the people they love and cherish.
