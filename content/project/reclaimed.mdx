*reclaimed* is a series of watercolour paintings exploring the perceived boundary between the *natural* and the *man-made.* In modern society, there is a popular view of a separation between the untouched wilds and the civilized, developed society; sometimes, the views goes so far as to posit that everything man does is harmful to the natural ecosystems.

Yet, humanity and Earth is inextricably linked. Perhaps the green world is not as fragile and unforgiving as we believe it to be. Perhaps the very belief that a boundary exists is a.

The series of paintings depicts abandoned, delipidated, and sometimes forgotten built structures being reclaimed by our green neighbours. What was deemed as lifeless and useless for society is instead teeming with life and purpose by another definition. The clear boundary that once existed between the *wild* and the *built* is blurred, gently filled, and quietly inhabited.

Could this space be something we design *for*, not *against*?

Words were added at a later date to accompany the pieces in a printed format.

  we walk this place  
  our feet planted to the earth  
  our hearts grown from the soil  
  our life nurtured through love&mdash;

  so it is.

  with the world as our playground  
  we find fun with the forgotten  
  and fill the abandoned with laughter,

  we grow over our oldest ancestors  
  and sprout up&mdash;pushed  
  by a history on the fringes of memory.

  so we are, as children,  
  loved by the earth  
  and beckoned by the green and the breathing

  to this place  
  <br />
  reclaimed

  her heart squeezed, tightened, quickened her breath. she couldn't look away; every second added another drop to an overflowing cup of awe. every beat was painful and pleasant; every intake filled her with desire, every exhale moved her to action.

  her fingers twitched restlessly while her feet stood rooted.

  she ingrained every colour, every sound, every flicker of light, to memory.

  she called it love.

  the green and the breathing were calling her name.

  a whispering beckon; a faint cry.

  it came from beyond the mountains. beyond the faded blue-greens that rose to caress the soft clouds and to kiss the cold sky. it came from that place of blurred blues turned deep purple, where the trees become indistinct edges, and eagles fly as the kings of their sky.

  ### epilogue

  the reclaimed is where the wisdom of the world grows over and into the remnants of humanity; where the green and the breathing sing their ancient pasts into the dirt and soil, once again; where the abandoned are filled with new life.

  to me, the green and the breathing is all life on earth, and everything is alive and singing.
